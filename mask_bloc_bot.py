Hi everyone! If you're waiting to get access to the full server, please don't say who invited you or post an intro yet.

To get access, you need to react to the server guidelines post https://discord.com/channels/1073227549867520101/1200982159826108456/1200983315730145443, and the person who invited you needs to vouch for you in a private channel. One of the mods will then give you access manually. Thanks!
